# suppliersCustomers
Suppliers and Customers management system used in narrow fabric factory, written in Java

This program was written in 2004 when I worked in a textile company as a textile technician. I wrote this program to manage suppliers and customers information. It used Java core,Swing,JDBC etc.

In order to run this program and get the snapshot,I have to comment out the database connection. The textile company I worked for has been now closed. The database is lost. I keep the programe only, not the database.
